            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my personal webpage! I am Gayathri Srujana Manda, a dedicated and passionate graduate student currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at the University at Albany, SUNY. With a strong foundation in Electronics and Communications Engineering and a keen interest in data science, I have developed a diverse skill set that includes programming, data analysis, and machine learning.</p>
            <p>My professional experience includes an internship at PricewaterhouseCoopers where I worked on Oracle ERP Cloud Security, and a student assistant role at the ITS Service Desk at SUNY Albany. These roles have equipped me with hands-on experience in data security, customer service, and IT support.</p>
            <p>I am actively seeking job opportunities in the field of data science where I can apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects. I am particularly interested in roles that involve data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.</p>
